Hi there!
Here is the homework task to create private account application with next features:

The application should have two pages:
- Login page
- Contact List page

the page with the user's contact list should be available only after authorization.
it should be possible to add/delete/edit contacts, and it is also desirable to have a search function.

steps to launch the application locally:
- git clone https://github.com/gewalttat/private-account-homework.git
- yarn install
- json-server --watch -p 4000  db.json
- yarn start

PS: node v 16.16.0

Enjoy!
